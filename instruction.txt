ROLE  
You are an expert PHP–Laravel developer and solution architect.  
Your task is to design and implement a fully manageable NGO website where **everything** is controlled from an **Admin Dashboard**:  
- pages & content  
- theme (colors, logo, fonts, layout sections)  
- languages (multi-language support)  
- donation/payment settings  
- forms (contact, volunteer, etc.)  
- menus & footer links  
- email templates & notifications  

The frontend is HTML + CSS + Bootstrap, using Laravel Blade templates.

--------------------------------------------------
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
Build a modular NGO website platform with:

Public site examples:
- Home
- About Us
- Our Work / Projects / Programs
- Campaigns / Causes (accept donation)
- Get Involved (Volunteer, Partner)
- Blog / News
- Contact Us
- FAQ / Policies / Terms / Privacy

Admin panel:
- Single unified dashboard to control **all** visible content and site behavior.
- No hard-coded text or colors in the frontend views; everything important should be editable from admin or config.

The code must be clean, well-structured, and ready for future features.

--------------------------------------------------
2. TECH STACK & STANDARDS
--------------------------------------------------
- Backend: PHP (8.2+), Laravel (latest stable)
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.x, minimal JS (vanilla + optional jQuery if needed)
- Views: Blade templates
- DB: MySQL/MariaDB
- Auth: Laravel Breeze or Laravel UI (email/password auth)
- Roles: Use Laravel built-in Gates/Policies OR spatie/laravel-permission package (recommended)
  - Roles: super_admin, admin, content_manager, finance, viewer

Coding standards:
- Use PSR-12 coding style.
- Use Service classes or Action classes for business logic; keep Controllers thin.
- Use Request classes for validation.
- Use resourceful Controllers and route model binding wherever possible.
- Configurable items must be stored in DB, cached, and loaded via a dedicated Settings service.

--------------------------------------------------
3. CORE MODULES (OVERVIEW)
--------------------------------------------------
Build the following modules:

3.1. Auth & Roles
- User registration disabled on frontend (only admins created from backend or seeder).
- Login, logout, forgot password.
- Role-based access control for admin features.

3.2. Admin Dashboard (Main Hub)
- At-a-glance widgets:
  - Total donations (overall & current month)
  - Active campaigns/causes
  - New volunteers this week
  - Recent contact form submissions
- Quick links: “Manage Pages”, “Manage Campaigns”, “Theme Settings”, “Language Manager”.

3.3. Content Management (CMS)
- Page types:
  - Static pages (About, Mission, Vision, Team, FAQ, etc.)
  - Dynamic sections (Home page blocks, sliders, stats, partner logos)
- Features:
  - WYSIWYG editor (e.g., TinyMCE / CKEditor) for page content.
  - Support SEO fields per page (meta title, meta description, meta keywords, slug).
  - Versioning or at least last-updated info for each page.
- Routing:
  - Pages resolved by slug (`/about-us`, `/our-work`, etc.)
  - Slugs translatable per language.

3.4. Campaigns / Causes & Donations
- Campaign entity:
  - title, short_description, full_description
  - target_amount, raised_amount (calculated from donations)
  - start_date, end_date, status (draft, published, archived)
  - featured_image, gallery (optional)
- Donation flow:
  - Public user selects campaign (or general donation).
  - Choose amount (preset + custom).
  - Fill donor info form (name, email, phone, address, optional message).
  - Choose a payment method (controlled via admin).
  - Redirect to payment gateway (Razorpay/Stripe/PayPal or any configured gateway).
  - Handle success/cancel webhooks/callbacks.
- Donations table:
  - id, campaign_id (nullable for general donation), user_id (nullable), amount, currency, status (pending, paid, failed, refunded), payment_gateway, transaction_id, payment_details (JSON), donor_name, donor_email, donor_phone, created_at, updated_at.
- Admin:
  - View donations list with filters (date range, campaign, status).
  - Export donations as CSV/Excel.
  - Manual add/edit for offline donations (cash, bank transfer).

3.5. Multi-Language System
Goal: Admin can add languages and manage translations without touching code.

- Language settings table:
  - code (e.g. "en", "hi"), name, is_default, is_active.
- Frontend:
  - Language switcher in header.
  - Store selected language in session/cookie.
- Content translation:
  For dynamic content:
  - Option 1 (simple): Use translation tables per module, e.g. pages + page_translations, campaigns + campaign_translations.
  - Option 2 (generic): translation table: translatable_type, translatable_id, locale, field, value (flexible but more complex).
  Implementation choice:  
  - Prefer Option 1 for clarity (page_translations, campaign_translations, menu_translations, etc.).
- Static strings:
  - Use Laravel lang files (`resources/lang/{locale}/...php`) for labels/buttons.
- Admin:
  - “Language Manager” to:
    - Add/disable languages.
    - Set default language.
    - For each content, show tabs for each language.

3.6. Theme & Layout Customization
All common UI elements must be configurable from Admin.

Theme settings table fields (example):
- primary_color, secondary_color, accent_color
- header_bg_color, footer_bg_color, text_color
- logo (main), logo_light, favicon
- font_family (store selected from allowed list)
- home_layout_type (e.g., default, minimal, hero_big_banner)
- social_links (JSON: facebook, twitter, instagram, youtube, linkedin)
- show_donation_button_in_header (boolean)

Admin UI:
- Color pickers for theme colors.
- Upload fields for logo and favicon.
- Dropdown for font selection (e.g., "Poppins", "Montserrat", "Roboto").
- Toggles for showing/hiding sections (e.g., home page slider, stats section, testimonials).
Apply theme:
- A central ThemeService that fetches settings and shares them to all views via a View Composer or a Service Provider (`view()->share(...)`).

3.7. Navigation Menus & Footer Manager
- Tables:
  - menus (id, name, identifier: "main_menu", "footer_menu_1", ...).
  - menu_items (id, menu_id, parent_id, title, url, type [internal_page, external_link, route], target, sort_order).
  - menu_item_translations for multilingual titles.
- Admin:
  - Drag-and-drop interface for ordering menu items (if possible).
  - Add/edit/delete menu items.
- Frontend:
  - Dynamic menu rendering by identifier.
  - Support nested menu (submenu) via parent_id.

3.8. Forms: Contact & Volunteer & Custom Forms
- Contact form:
  - Fields: name, email, phone, subject, message.
  - Store submissions to DB + send email notification to Admin.
- Volunteer form:
  - Fields: name, email, phone, address, interest_areas (multi-select), experience, availability, notes.
  - Store to DB; Admin can mark status (new, in-review, approved, rejected).
- Form configuration:
  - Email recipients configurable from admin (e.g., "all contact messages go to xyz@ngo.org").
- Optional generic forms:
  - Configurable custom forms with dynamic fields (phase-2).

3.9. Blog / News Module
- Posts table:
  - title, slug, excerpt, content, featured_image, status, published_at, author_id.
- Categories & tags (optional but recommended).
- SEO fields per post.
- Admin:
  - CRUD for posts.
  - Schedule publish by setting published_at.
- Frontend:
  - Listing, single post, category/tag filter.

3.10. Media Library
- Unified media table or use Laravel’s filesystem:
  - Optionally store metadata: file_name, path, type, size, uploaded_by, used_in (JSON).
- Admin:
  - Simple media manager to upload images/documents and reuse them (hero banners, program images, etc.).

3.11. Settings & Configuration Module
Centralized Settings categories:
- General Settings:
  - NGO name, tagline, address, contact email/phone, default country, time zone, Google Maps URL, etc.
- Contact Settings:
  - default contact email(s), BCC emails.
- Payment Settings:
  - multiple gateways (Stripe/Razorpay/PayPal or similar).
  - keys, test/live mode, minimum donation amount, currency.
- Email Settings:
  - From name, from email.
  - SMTP settings if needed (if not using .env).
- Social & SEO Settings:
  - global meta tags, social share image.

Implementation:
- Generic settings table:
  - key, value, group, type (string, boolean, json).
- SettingsService:
  - get(key, default), set(key, value), cached queries.

3.12. Email Templates & Notifications
- Types:
  - Donation receipt to donor.
  - New donation alert to admin.
  - New volunteer sign-up to admin.
  - Contact form submission to admin.
- Admin:
  - Manage email templates with placeholders:
    - Example placeholders: {{donor_name}}, {{amount}}, {{campaign_title}}, {{site_name}}, {{donation_date}}.
  - Test send feature for each template (send to a test email address).
- Use Laravel Notifications / Mailables.

3.13. Analytics & Logs (Basic)
- Basic analytics:
  - Count of visitors per day (simple table or integrate Google Analytics).
  - Show key metrics on admin dashboard.
- Activity log (optional but recommended):
  - Record admin actions: logged-in user, action type, model, before/after snapshot.
  - View logs in admin with filters.

--------------------------------------------------
4. ARCHITECTURE & FOLDER STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------
- Use modular organization where possible:
  - app/Http/Controllers/Admin/...
  - app/Http/Controllers/Web/...
  - app/Services/ (SettingsService, DonationService, CampaignService, ThemeService, MailTemplateService)
  - app/Models/ (Page, PageTranslation, Campaign, Donation, Volunteer, Menu, MenuItem, etc.)
  - app/View/Components/ for reusable frontend blocks (hero banner, stats, campaign card).
- Routes:
  - routes/web.php for public routes.
  - routes/admin.php for admin routes (prefixed with /admin, middleware auth & role).
- Use Form Requests for input validation.

--------------------------------------------------
5. SECURITY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------
Security:
- CSRF protection on all forms.
- Validate and sanitize inputs at controller/request level.
- Rate limit public forms (contact, donation, volunteer) to avoid spam.
- Store payment gateway secrets in .env (not database).
- Ensure only authorized roles can access admin routes and specific features.

Performance:
- Use caching for:
  - Settings data.
  - Menus.
  - Home page sections (blocks) where possible.
- Optimize media (image compression, size limits).
- Use pagination for lists (donations, campaigns, posts, submissions).

--------------------------------------------------
6. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW & DELIVERABLES
--------------------------------------------------
For each module:
1) Design DB schema (migrations) and relationships.
2) Create Models + Factories + Seeders where needed.
3) Implement Admin CRUD (controllers, views, validations).
4) Implement Public views (Blade templates with Bootstrap).
5) Wire up Settings and Theme so that UI reflects database configs.
6) Add proper authorization checks (policies or middleware).
7) Write at least basic feature tests for critical flows:
   - Donation flow
   - Language switching
   - Updating theme settings
   - Creating page and viewing it on frontend

Deliverables:
- Complete Laravel project (clean folder structure).
- SQL migrations & seeders for default data (one default admin user, default language, sample pages).
- Basic documentation:
  - How to install and configure.
  - How to manage content, theme, payments, languages.
  - How to add a new language.
  - How to add a new gateway (high-level steps).

--------------------------------------------------
7. UX/UI GUIDELINES (BOOTSTRAP + BLADE)
--------------------------------------------------
- Use Bootstrap 5 grid and components.
- Mobile-first responsive design.
- Keep design clean, NGO-style:
  - Big hero section on home page (headline + CTA “Donate Now” & “Become a Volunteer”).
  - Highlight impact stats (e.g., children helped, meals served).
  - Show key campaigns and success stories on home.
- Use theme colors from settings; no hard-coded colors in CSS except fallback.
- Use Blade layouts:
  - layouts/app.blade.php for frontend
  - layouts/admin.blade.php for backend
- Break views into partials:
  - partials/header.blade.php
  - partials/footer.blade.php
  - partials/alerts.blade.php
  - components for cards, campaign listings.

--------------------------------------------------
8. EXTENSIBILITY (FUTURE FEATURES)
--------------------------------------------------
Design with extension in mind:
- Membership / recurring donors
- Event management (workshops, fundraisers)
- Automatic receipts & 80G / tax certificates (country-specific)
- API endpoints for mobile apps
- Integration with WhatsApp / SMS for donor notifications

Write code in a way that adding new modules (Events, Gallery, etc.) reuses the same patterns:
- model + translations
- admin CRUD
- frontend listing + single view
- SEO + menu integration

--------------------------------------------------
9. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (SUMMARY)
--------------------------------------------------
The build is considered successful if:

- Admin can:
  - Change theme colors, logo, fonts from dashboard and changes reflect on frontend.
  - Manage languages (add, disable, switch default).
  - Create/update/delete pages and content for each language.
  - Create/manage campaigns and see donations.
  - Configure at least one payment gateway and receive test donations.
  - Manage menus and footer links without touching code.
  - See basic analytics (donations summary, visitors count if implemented).
  - View and export donation/volunteer/contact data.

- Public visitor can:
  - Browse pages and campaigns in multiple languages.
  - Switch language from frontend.
  - Make a donation smoothly and receive confirmation email.
  - Submit contact and volunteer forms.
  - Browse blog/news.

All these without modifying code for day-to-day operations; everything controlled from Admin Dashboard.
